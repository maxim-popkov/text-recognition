1
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,450
"Once upon a time there was a lovely princess

2
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,290
"But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort...

3
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,220
"which could only be broken by love's first kiss.

4
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,660
"She was locked away in a castle...

5
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,960
"guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.

6
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,400
"Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this deadful prison.

7
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,270
"but none prevailed.

8
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,510
"She waited in the dragon's keep...

9
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,510
"in the highest room of the tallest tower...

10
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,150
for her true love and true love's first kiss. "

11
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,180
Like that's ever gonna happen

12
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,990
- What a load of -

13
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,690
Somebody once told me
the world is gonna roll me

14
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,760
I ain't the sharpest tool
in the shed

15
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,730
She was lookin' kind of dumb
with her finger and her thumb

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,540
In the shape of an "L"
on the forehead

17
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,540
The years start comin'
and they don't stop commin'

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,440
Fed to the rules
and I hit the ground runnin'

19
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,780
Didn't make sense
not live for fun

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,120
Your brain gets smart
but your head gets dumb

21
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,080
So much to do
So much to see

22
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,790
So what's wrong with
takin' the backstreets

23
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,890
You'll never know
if you don't go

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,390
You'll never shine
if you don't glow

25
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,460
Hey, now
You're an all-star

26
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,900
Get your game on, go play

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,900
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid

28
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,940
And all that glitter is gold

29
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,480
Only shootin' stars
break the mould

30
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,550
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

31
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,810
You're bundled up now but wait till you get older

32
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,020
But the meteor men beg to differ

33
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,990
Judging by the hole
in the satellite picture

34
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,790
The ice we skate
is gettin' pretty thin

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,860
The water's getting warm
so you might as well swim

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,830
My world's on fire
How 'bout yours

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,590
That's the way I like it
and I'll never get bored

38
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,300
- Hey, now, you're an all-star

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,000
Get your game on go play

40
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,200
Hey, now you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid

41
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,970
And all that glitter is gold

42
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,980
Only shootin' stars break the mould

43
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,790
- Go!
- Go!

44
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,020
- Go. Go. Go.

45
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,660
Hey, now You're an all-star

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,830
Get your game on, go play

47
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,170
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid

48
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,140
And all that glitter is gold

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,510
Only shootin' stars break the mould

50
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,480
- Think it's in there?
- All right. Let's get it!

51
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,320
Whoa, Hold on. Do you know
what thing can do to you?

52
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,320
Yeah, it'll grind
your bones for its bread.

53
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,390
Yes, well, actually,
that would be a giant.

54
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,530
Now, ogres-
They're much worse.

55
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,530
They'll make a suit
from your freshly peeled skin.

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,700
- No!
- They'll shave your liver.

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,040
Squeeze the
jelly from your eyes!

58
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,670
- Actualy, it's quite good on toast.
- Back! Back, beast!

59
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,880
Back! I warn ya!

60
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,220
-Right.

61
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,570
This is the part
where you run away.

62
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,410
And stay out!

63
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,350
"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures. "

64
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,290
All right. This one's full

65
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,990
- Take it away!

66
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,930
- Move it along. Come on! Get up!
- Next!

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,940
Give me that! Your flying days are over.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,640
That's 20 pieces of silver
for the witch. Next!

69
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,470
- Get up! Come on!
- Twenty pieces.

70
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,910
- Sit down there!

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,510
- Keep quiet!

72
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,480
This cage is too small.

73
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,620
Please don't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again.

74
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
I can change.
Please! Give ma another chance!

75
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,160
-Oh, shut up.
-Oh! - Next!

76
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,130
-What have you got?
- This little wooden puppet.

77
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,130
I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

78
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,600
Five shillings forthe possessed toy.

79
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,770
- Take it away.
- Father, please! Don't let them do this!

80
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,770
- Help me!
- Next. What have you got?

81
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,470
- Well, I've got a talking donkey.

82
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,140
Right. Well, that's good for
ten shillings, if you can prouve it.

83
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,110
Oh, go ahead, little fella.

84
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,120
Well?

85
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,920
Oh, oh, he's just-
He's just a little nervous.

86
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,960
He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt-

87
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,660
- That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
-No, no, he talks!

88
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,830
He does. I can talk. I love to talk.

89
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,830
I'm the talkingest
damn thing you ever saw.

90
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,470
- Get her out of my sight.
-No, no!

91
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,940
I swear! Oh! He can talk!

92
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,680
Hey! I can fly!

93
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,380
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

94
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,520
- He can talk!
Ha, ha! That's right, fool!

95
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,890
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

96
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,560
Your right have seen a house fly
maybe even a super fly,

97
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,690
but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly.

98
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,690
Ha, ha!

99
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,700
Uh-oh.

100
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,070
Seize him!

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,840
After him!
He's getting away!

102
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,880
Get him! This way! Turn!

103
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,390
You there. Ogre!

104
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,790
Aye?

105
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,930
By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am
authorized to place you under arrest...

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,600
and transport you to
a designated... resettlement facility.

107
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,740
Oh, really?
You and what army?

108
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,490
Can I say something to you?

109
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,920
Listen, you was really, really somethin'
back there. Incredible!

110
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,760
Are you talkin' to-
me? Whoa!

111
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,800
Yes, I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you
that you was great back there? Those guards!

112
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,600
They thought they was all of that.
Then you showed up, and bam!

113
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,640
They was trippin' over themselves
like babes in the woods.

114
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,640
That really made me
feel good to see that.

115
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,740
- Oh, that's great. Really.
- Man, it's good to be free.

116
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,410
Now, why don't you go celebrate your
freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

117
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,820
But, uh, I don't have any friends.

118
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,550
And I'm not goin' out there by myself.

119
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,160
Hey, wait a minute! I got
a great idea! I'll stick with you.

120
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,160
You're a mean, green, fightin' machine.

121
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,460
Together we'll scare
the spit out of anybody that crosses us.

122
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,500
Oh, wow! That was really scary.

123
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,310
If you don't mind me sayin' if that don(t work,
your breath certainly will get the job done,

124
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,540
'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs
or something, 'cause your breath stinks!

125
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,810
You almost burned the hair outta my nose,

126
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,710
just like the time-

127
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,520
Then I ate some rotten berries. I had
strong gases eking out of my butt that day.

128
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,320
Why are you following me?

129
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,990
I'll tell you why.

130
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,030
'Cause I'm all alone

131
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,800
There's no one here beside me

132
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,600
My problems have all gone

133
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,010
There's no one to deride me

134
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,040
But you gotta have friend-

135
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Stop singing!

136
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,310
It's no wonder
you don't have any friends.

137
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,050
Wow. Only a true friend
would be that truly honest.

138
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,190
Listen, little donkey.
Take a look at me. What am I?

139
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,160
Uh-

140
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,330
-Really tall?
- No! I'm an ogre.

141
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,630
You know.
"Grab your torch and pitchforks. "

142
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Doesn't that bother you?

143
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,940
Nope.

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,910
- Really?
- Really,really.

145
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,110
- Oh.
- Man, I like you. What's your name?

146
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,810
Uh, Shrek.

147
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,180
Shrek? Well, you know
what I like about you, Shrek?

148
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,290
You got a kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-
thinks-of-me thing.

149
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,190
I like that.
I respect that, Shrek. You alright.

150
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,260
Whoo! Look at that. Who'd want
to live in a place like that?

151
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,570
That would be my home.

152
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,530
Oh! And it is lovely!
Just beautiful.

153
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,440
You are quite a decorator. It's amazing
what you've done with such a modest budget.

154
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,210
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.

155
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,680
I guess you don't
entertain much, do you?

156
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,590
I like my privacy.

157
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,290
You know, I do too.
That's another thing we have in comon.

158
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,590
Like, I hate it when
you got somebody in your face.

159
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,590
You're trying to give them a hint, and they
won't leave. There's that awkward silence.

160
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,470
- Can I stay with you?
- Uh, what?

161
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,100
Can I stay with you, please?

162
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,510
- Of course!
- Really?

163
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,940
- No.
- Please! I don't wanna go back there!

164
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,940
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.

165
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,610
But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay!

166
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,850
- Please! Please!
- Okay! Okay!

167
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,520
- But one night only.
- Ah! Thank you!

168
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,960
- What are you- No! No!
- This is gonna be fun!

169
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,960
We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories,

170
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,830
and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

171
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,130
- Oh!
- Where do, uh, I sleep?

172
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,000
Outside!

173
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,170
Oh,well,
I guess that's cool.

174
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,270
I mean, I don't know you,
and you don't know me,

175
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,740
so I guess outside is best, you know.

176
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,840
Here I go.

177
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,120
Good night.

178
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,220
I mean, I do like the outdoors.
I'm a donkey. I was born outside.

179
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,960
I'll just be sitting by myself
outside, I guess, you know.

180
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,330
By myself, outside.

181
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm all alone.
There's no one here beside me

182
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,100
I thought I told you to stay outside.

183
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,870
- I am outside.

184
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,140
Well, gents, it's a far cry from
the farm, but what choice do we have?

185
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,780
It's not home,
but it'll do just fine.

186
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,750
What a lovely bed.

187
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,180
- Got ya.
- I found some cheese.

188
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,750
- Ow!
- Blah! Awful stuff.

189
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,120
-Is that you, Gorder?
- How did you know?

190
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,090
Enough!
What are you doing in my house?

191
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,130
Hey!

192
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,800
- Oh!, no, no, no.

193
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,500
- Dead broad off the table.
- Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.

194
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,740
Huh?

195
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,480
What?

196
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,310
I live in a swamp. I put up signs.
I'm a terrifying ogre!

197
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,980
What do I have to do
to get a little privacy?

198
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,520
-Aah!
- Oh, no.

199
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,290
Oh, no.

200
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,990
- No! No!

201
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,990
- What?

202
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,000
- Quit it.
- Don't push.

203
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,300
What are you doing
in my swamp?

204
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,810
Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

205
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,110
- Oh, dear!

206
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,840
Whoa!

207
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,310
All right, get out of here.
All of you, move it!

208
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,780
Come on! Let's go!
Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!

209
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,820
- Quickly. Come on!
- No, no!

210
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,120
No, no.
Not there. Not there.

211
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,660
- Oh!

212
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,660
Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

213
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,830
Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

214
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,530
- What?
- We were forced to come here.

215
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,740
- By who?
- Lord Farquaad.

216
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,570
He huffed und he puffed und he...
signed an eviction notice.

217
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,340
All right.

218
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,710
Who knows where
this Farquaad guy is?

219
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,580
- Oh, I do. I know where he is.

220
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,350
Does anyone else
know where to find him?

221
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,090
- Anyone at all?
- Me! Me!

222
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,090
- Anyone?
- Oh! Oh, pick me!

223
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,560
Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

224
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,800
Okay, fine.

225
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,400
Attention,
all fairy tale things.

226
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,210
Do not get comfortable.
Your welcome is officially worn out.

227
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,010
In fact, I'm gonna see
this guy Farquaad right now...

228
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,220
and get you all off my land
and back where you came from!

229
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Oh! You!

230
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,730
You're comin' with me.

231
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,130
All right, that's
what I like to hear, man

232
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,000
Shrek and donkey, two stalwart friends,
off on a whirlwind big-city adventure.

233
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
I love it!

234
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,370
- On the road again

235
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,410
I can't wait to get
on the road again

236
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,410
What did I say
about singing?

237
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,410
- Can I whistle?
- No.

238
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,280
- Can I hum it?
- All right, hum it.

239
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,110
That's enough.
He's ready to talk.

240
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,530
Run, run, run,
as fast as you can.

241
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,100
You can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man!

242
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,840
- You're a monster.
- I'm not the monster here. You are.

243
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,170
You and the rest of that fairy tale
trash, poisoning my perfect world.

244
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,140
Now, tell me!
Where are the others?

245
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,780
- Eat me!

246
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,750
I've tried to be fair
to you creatures.

247
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,390
Now my patience has reached its end!
Tell me or I'll-

248
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,260
No, no, not the buttons.
Not my gumdrop buttons.

249
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,360
All right then.
Who's hiding them?

250
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,760
Okay, I'll tell you.
Do you know the muffin man?

251
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,170
- The muffin man?
- The muffin man.

252
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,700
Yes, I know the muffin man,
who lives on Drury Lane?

253
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,170
Well, she's married
to the muffin man.

254
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,410
- The muffin man?
- The muffin man!

255
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,510
- She's married to the muffin man.

256
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,250
My lord! We found it.

257
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,550
Then what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

258
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,400
- Oh!

259
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,830
- Magic mirror-
- Don't tell him anything!

260
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,270
No!

261
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,110
- Evening.

262
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,040
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

263
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,550
Is this not the most
perfect kingdom of them all?

264
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,180
Well, technically
you're not a king.

265
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,650
Uh, Thelonius.

266
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,420
- You were saying?
- What I mean is, you're not a king yet.

267
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,060
But you can become one. All
you have to do is marry a princess.

268
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,130
- Go on.

269
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,900
So, just sit back
and relax, my lord,

270
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,240
because it's time for you to
meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

271
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,910
And here they are!

272
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,980
Bachelorette number one is a mentally
abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away.

273
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,320
She likes sushi
and hot tubbing anytime.

274
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,850
Her hobbies include cooking
and cleaning for her two evil sisters.

275
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,290
Please welcome Cinderella.

276
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,430
Bachelorette number two\is a cape-wearing girl
from the land of fancy.

277
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,230
Although she lives with
seven other men, she's not easy.

278
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,770
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips
and find out what a live wire she is.

279
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,570
Come on.
Give it up for Snow White!

280
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,340
And last,
but certainly not least,

281
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,510
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead...

282
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,110
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot boiling lava!

283
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,250
But don't let that cool you off.

284
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,480
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina
coladas and getting caught in the rain.

285
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,620
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

286
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,160
So will it be
bachelorette number one,

287
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,760
bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three?

288
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,990
- Two! Two!
- Three! Three!

289
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,430
- Two! Two!
- Three!

290
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,630
Three? One?
Three?

291
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,800
Three!
Pick number three, my lord!

292
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,600
Okay, okay, uh, number three!

293
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,410
Lord Farquaad,
you've chosen Princess Fiona.

294
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,350
If you love pina coladas

295
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,720
- And getting caught in the rain
- Princess Fiona.

296
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,980
- If you're not into yoga

297
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,820
All I have to do is
just find someone who can go-

298
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,160
But I probably should mention
the little thing that happens at night.

299
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,160
- I'll do it.
- Yes, but after sunset-

300
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,330
Silence! I will make
this Princess Fiona my queen,

301
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,600
and DuLoc will finally
have the perfect king!

302
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,870
Captain, assemble
your finet men.

303
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,840
We're going to have
a tournament.

304
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,540
But that's it. That'st it
right there. That's DuLoc.

305
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,650
I told ya I'd find it.

306
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,850
So, that must be
Lord Farquaad's castle.

307
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,050
Uh-huh. That's the place.

308
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,520
Do you think maybe
he's compensating for something?

309
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,730
Hey, wait.
Wait up, Shrek.

310
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,700
Hurry, darling.
We're late. Hurry.

311
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,840
- Hey, you!

312
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,770
Wait a second.
Look, I'm not gonna eat ya.

313
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,740
- I just- I just-

314
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
It's quiet.

315
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,610
Too quiet.

316
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,290
- WHere is everybody?
- Hey, look at this!

317
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,140
Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town

318
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,640
Here we have some rules
Let us lay them down

319
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,610
Don't make waves, stay inline
and we'll get along fine

320
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,280
DuLoc is a perfect place

321
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:04,890
Please keep off of the grass
Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

322
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,590
DuLoc is, DuLoc is

323
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,130
DuLoc is a perfect

324
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,630
- Place

325
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,610
Wow! Let's do that again!

326
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,340
No. No.
No, no, no! No.

327
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,180
Brave knights.

328
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,380
- You are the best and brightest
in the land.

329
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,850
Today one of you
shall prove himself-

330
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,290
All right. You're going the right way
for a smacked bottom.

331
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,290
- Sorry about that.

332
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,900
That champion shall have the honour-
no,no- the privilege...

333
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,000
to go forth and rescue
the lovely Princess Fiona...

334
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,440
from the fiery keep
of the dragon

335
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,740
If for any reason
the winner is unsuccessful,

336
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,950
the fist runner-up
will take his place

337
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,880
and so on and so forth.

338
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:11,320
Some of you may die, but it's
a sacrifice I am willing to make.

339
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,930
Let the tournament begin!

340
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,530
- Oh!

341
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,900
- What is that?

342
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,510
- It's hideous!
-Ah, that's not very nice.

343
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,080
- It's just a donkey.
Huh?

344
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,080
Indeed. Knights, new plan!

345
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,890
The one who kills the ogre will be
named champion! Have at him!

346
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,890
- Get him!
- Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

347
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,260
Go ahead! Get him!

348
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,030
Can't we just settle this
over a pint?

349
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,360
Kill the beast!

350
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,930
No? All right then.

351
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,040
Come on!

352
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,250
I don't give a damn
about my reputation

353
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,390
-You've living in the past
It's a new generation

354
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,290
she wants to do

355
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,590
And that's what
I'm gonna do

356
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,600
And I don't give a damn
about my bad reputation

357
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,470
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Not me

358
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,265
Me, me, me

359
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,965
- Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

360
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,710
And I don't give a damn
about my reputation

361
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,080
Never said I wanted
to improve my station

362
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,680
Ah!

363
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,780
And I'm always feelin' good
when I'm having fun

364
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,950
And I don't have
to please no one

365
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,950
The chair!
Give him the chair!

366
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,650
And I don't give damn
about my bad reputation

367
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,890
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Not me

368
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,420
Me, me, me

369
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,160
Oh, no, no, no, no

370
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,930
Not me, not me

371
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,470
-Not me

372
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,840
Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah!

373
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,680
Thank you! Thank you very much!

374
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,150
I'm here till Thursday.
Try the veal! Ha, ha!

375
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,560
Shall I give
the order, sir?

376
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,260
No, I have a better idea.

377
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,500
People of DuLoc,
I give you our champion!

378
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,470
- What?
- Congratulations, ogre.

379
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,870
You've won the honour of
embarking on a great and noble quest.

380
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,340
Quest? I'm already on a quest,
a quest to get my swamp back.

381
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,650
- Your swamp?
- Yeah, my swamp!

382
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,180
Where you dumped
those fairy tale creatures!

383
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,890
- Indeed.

384
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,050
All right, ogre,
I'll make you a deal.

385
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,930
Go on this quest for me, and
I'll give you your swamp back.

386
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,730
Exactly the way it was?

387
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,530
Down to the last
slime-covered toadtool.

388
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,870
- And the squatters?
- As good as gone.

389
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,910
What kind of quest?

390
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,540
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna go fight a dragon...

391
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,280
and rescue a princess just so Farquaad
will give you back a swamp...

392
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,480
which you only don't have because he
filled it full of freaks in the first place.

393
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,890
- Is that about right?
- Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

394
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,520
I don't get it. Why don't you just
pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

395
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,560
Throttle him,
lay siege to his fortress,

396
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,430
grind his bones to make your bread,
the whole ogre trip.

397
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,470
Oh, I know what.

398
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,730
Maybe I could have
decapitated an entire village...

399
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,940
and put thier heads
on a pike,

400
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,670
gotten a knife, cut open thier
spleen and drink their fluids.

401
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,880
Does that sound
good to you?

402
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,610
Uh, no, not really, no.

403
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,480
For your information, there's a lot
more to ogres than people think.

404
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,280
- Example?
- Example?

405
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:08,520
- Okay, um, ogres are like onions.
- They stink?

406
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,890
- Yes- No! - They
make you cry? - No!

407
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,430
You leave them out in the sun, they get all
brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.

408
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,470
No! Layers!

409
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,870
Onions have layers.

410
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,300
Ogres have layers!
Onions have layers.

411
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,770
You gt it? We both have layers.

412
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,280
Oh, you both have layers. Oh.

413
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,780
You know, not everybody likes onions.

414
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,490
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

415
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,490
I don't care...
what everyone likes.

416
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,230
Ogres are not like cakes.

417
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,470
You know what else
everybody likes? Parfaits.

418
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,470
Have you ever met a person, you,
say, "Let's get some parfait,"

419
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,470
they say, "No,
I don't like no parfait"?

420
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,310
- Parfaits are delicious.
- No!

421
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,180
You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

422
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,140
Ogres are like onions!
End of the story.

423
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,210
Bye-bye. See ya later.

424
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,460
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet.

425
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,720
You know, I think
I preferred your humming.

426
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,490
Do you have a tissue or something?
I'm making a mess.

427
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,530
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

428
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:30,810
I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today.

429
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,410
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

430
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,980
I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today

431
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,480
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

432
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,490
And everything
that you receive up yonder

433
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,490
Is what you give to me
the day I wander

434
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,530
I'm on my way

435
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,530
I'm on my way

436
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,700
I'm on my way

437
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,270
Ooh! Shrek!
Did you do that?

438
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,140
You gotta warn somebody before you
just crack one off. My mouth was open.

439
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,950
Believe me, Donkey, if
it was me, you'd be dead.

440
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,750
It's brimstone.

441
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,020
- We must be getting close.
- Yeah, right, brimstone.

442
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:20,190
Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I
know what I smell. It's wasn't no brimstone.

443
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,220
It didn't come off
no stone neither.

444
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,580
Sure, it's big enough,
but look at the location.

445
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,420
Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when
you said ogres have layers?

446
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,420
Oh, aye.

447
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,130
Well, I have a bit
of a confession to make.

448
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,560
Donkeys don't have layers. We wear
our fear right out there on our sleeves.

449
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,730
- Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
- You know what I mean.

450
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,500
You can't tell me
you're afraid of heights.

451
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,170
I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on
a rickely bridge over a boiling lake of lava!

452
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,280
Come on, Donkey.
I'm right here beside ya, okay?

453
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,010
For emotional support,

454
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,690
we'll just tackle this thing
together one little baby stap at a time.

455
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,690
- Really?
- Really, really.

456
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,960
- Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
- Just keep moving.

457
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,630
- And don't look down. Okay,
don't look down. Don't look down.

458
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,100
Don't look down. \Keep on moving. Don't look down.

459
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,970
Shrek! I'm lookin' down!

460
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,970
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off, please!

461
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,610
- But you're already halfway.
- But I know that half is safe!

462
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,480
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

463
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,980
- Shrek, no! Wait!
- Just, Donkey-

464
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,190
- Let's have a dance then, shall we?
- Don't do that!

465
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,120
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

466
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,330
- Oh, this?
- Yes, that!

467
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,760
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

468
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,170
No Shrek!

469
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,400
- No! Stop it!
- You said do it! I'm doin' it.

470
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,740
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

471
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,280
Oh!

472
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,410
That'll do, Donkey.
That'll do.

473
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,980
Cool.

474
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,890
So where is this
fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

475
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,730
Inside, waiting for us
to rescue her.

476
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,690
I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

477
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,110
You afraid?

478
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,520
No, but- Shh.

479
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,090
Oh, good. Me neither.

480
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,590
'Cause there's nothin'
wrong with bein' afraid.

481
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,890
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

482
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,030
Unfamiliar dangerous
situation, I might add.

483
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,760
With a dragon that breathes fire
and eats knights and breathes fire,

484
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,300
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared.

485
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,370
I sure as heck ain't no coward.
I know that.

486
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,810
Donkey, two things, okay?

487
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,410
Shut... up.

488
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,250
Now go over there and see\if you can find any stairs.

489
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,980
Stairs? I thought
we was lookin' for the princess.

490
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:38,920
The princess will be up the stairs in
the highest room in the tallest tower.

491
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,590
- What makes you think she'll be there?
- I read it in a book once.

492
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,600
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

493
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,700
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt too.

494
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,770
Those stairs won't know
which way they're goin'.

495
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,240
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

496
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,110
Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess
with me. I'm the stair master.

497
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,780
I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had
a step right here. I'd step all over it.

498
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,290
Well, at least we know
where the princess is, but where's the-

499
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,660
Dragon!

500
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,480
Donkey, look out!

501
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,160
- Got ya!

502
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:54,600
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

503
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,220
Oh! Aah! Aah!

504
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,330
No. Oh, no. No!

505
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,030
- Oh, what large teeth you have.

506
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,970
I mean, white, sparkling teeth. I know you
probably hear this all the time from your food,

507
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,170
but you must bleach, 'cause that
is one dazzling smile you got there.

508
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,780
Do I detect a hint
of minty freshness?

509
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,610
And you know what else?
You're- you're a girl dragon!

510
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,190
Oh, sure! I mean,
of course you're a girl dragon.

511
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,060
You're just reeking
off feminine beauty.

512
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,490
What's the matter with you?
You got something in your eye?

513
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,390
Ooh. Oh. Oh.

514
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,860
Man, I'd really love to stay,
but, you know, I'm, uh-

515
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,900
I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd
work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings.

516
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,940
Shrek!

517
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,770
No! Shrek! Shrek!

518
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,780
Shrek!

519
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,470
Oh! Oh!

520
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,480
- WAke up!
- What?

521
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,180
Are you Princess Fiona?

522
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:54,580
I am, awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

523
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,690
Oh, that's nice.
Now let's go!

524
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,790
But wait, Sir Knight.

525
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,120
This be-ith our first meeting.

526
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,930
Should it not be
a wonderful, romantic moment?

527
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:09,370
- Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
- Hey, wait. What are you doing?

528
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,500
You should sweep me off my feet...

529
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,970
out yonder window and down a rope
onto your valiant steed.

530
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,870
You've had a lot of time
to plan this, haven't you?

531
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,210
Mm-hmm.

532
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,180
But we have to
savour this moment!

533
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,980
You could recite
an epic poem for me.

534
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,550
A ballad? A sonnet!

535
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,890
- A limerick? Or something!
- I don't think so.

536
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,390
Can I at least know
the name of my champion?

537
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,400
Um, Shrek.

538
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,170
Sir Shrek.

539
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:49,000
I pray that you take this favour
as a token of my gratitude.

540
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,140
Thanks!

541
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,950
You didn't slay the dragon?

542
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,520
- It's on my to-do list. Now come on!

543
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,190
But this isn't right!

544
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,550
You were meant to charge in,
sword drawn, banner flying.

545
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,690
That's what all
the other knights did.

546
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,090
Yeah, right before
they burst into flame.

547
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,730
That's not the point. Oh!

548
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,230
Wait. Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

549
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,370
Well, I have to save my ass.

550
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,670
What kind of knight are you?

551
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,170
One of a kind.

552
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,610
Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.

553
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,950
I believe it's healthy to get to
know someone over a long period of time.

554
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,580
Just call me old-fashioned.

555
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,190
I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship.

556
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,720
I'm not that emotionally ready
for commitment of, uh, this-

557
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,130
Magnitude really is
the word I'm looking for.

558
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,730
Magnitude- Hey, that is
unwanted physical contact.

559
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,230
Hey, what are you doing?

560
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,570
Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little
and take this one step at a time.

561
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,810
We really should get to know each other
first as friends or pen pals.

562
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:01,080
I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards-

563
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,580
I'd really love
to stay, but-

564
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,250
Don't do that. That's my tail!
That's my personal tail.

565
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,750
You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission
- What are you gonna do with that?

566
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,620
Hey, now. No way.
No! No!

567
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,460
No, no! No.
No, no, no! No! Oh!

568
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,290
- Hi, Princess!
- It talks!

569
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,130
Yeah, it's getting him
to shut up that's the trick.

570
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,030
Oh!

571
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,630
Okay, you two,
head for the exit!

572
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,300
I'll take care of the dragon.

573
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:28,590
- You did it!

574
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,530
You rescued me!
You're amizing. You're-

575
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,360
You're wonderful. You're...

576
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,770
a little unorthodox I'll admit.

577
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:42,740
But thy deed is great,
and thine heart is pure.

578
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,640
- I am eternally in your debt.

579
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,050
And where would a brave knight be
without his noble steed?

580
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,820
I hope you heard that. She called me
a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.

581
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,060
The battle is won.

582
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,620
You may remove your helmet,
good Sir Knight.

583
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,330
- Uh, no.
- Why not?

584
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,560
I have helmet hair.

585
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,870
Please. I would'st look
upon the face of my rescuer.

586
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,570
No, no, you wouldn't- 'st.

587
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,100
But how will you kiss me?

588
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,940
What? That wasn't
in the job description.

589
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,440
Maybe it's a perk.

590
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,920
No. It's destiny.
Oh, you must know how it goes.

591
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,790
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon...

592
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,820
is rescue by a brave knight,

593
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,160
and then they share true love's first kiss.

594
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,330
Hmm? With Shrek?
You think- Wait.

595
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,600
Wait. You think Shrek is your true love?

596
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
Well, yes.

597
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,170
You think that Shrek is your true love!

598
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,170
What is so funny?

599
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,340
Let's just say,
I'm not your type, okay?

600
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,950
Of course you are.
You're my rescuer.

601
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,480
Now- Now remove your helmet.

602
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,790
Look. I really don't think
this is a good idea.

603
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,860
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.

604
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,120
- Take it off!
- No!

605
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,290
- Now!
- Okay!

606
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,860
Easy. As you command,
Your Highness.

607
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,380
You- You're a- an ogre.

608
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,350
Oh, you were expecting
Prince Charming.

609
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,950
Well, yes, actually.

610
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,090
Oh no. This is all wrong.

611
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,490
You're not supposed
to be an ogre.

612
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:46,830
Princess, I was sent
to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

613
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,830
He's the one
who wants to marry you.

614
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,830
Then why didn't
he come to rescue me?

615
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,270
Good question. You should
ask him that when we get there.

616
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,370
But I have to be rescued
by my true love,

617
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,240
not by some ogre and his- his pet.

618
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,380
Well so much for noble steed.

619
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,050
Look princess. You're not making my job any easier.

620
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,520
Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.

621
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:14,860
You can tell Lord Farquaad
that if he wants to rescue me properly,

622
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,290
I'll be waiting for him
right here.

623
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,400
Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy,
all right? I'm a delivery boy.

624
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,770
You wouldn't dare.

625
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,870
- Ya comin', Donkey?
- Put me down!

626
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,870
Yeah, I'm right behind ya.

627
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,580
Put me down or you will
suffer the consequences!

628
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,110
This is not dignified!
Put me down!

629
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,120
Okay, so here's another question.

630
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,220
Say there's a woman that digs you, right,
but you don't really like her that way.

631
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,690
How do you let her down real easy
so her feelings aren't hurt,

632
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,260
but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?

633
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,090
You just tell her
she's not your true love.

634
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,900
Everyone knows it what happens when you find your-

635
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,570
Hey!

636
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,930
The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.

637
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,940
Oh, yeah. You're gonna love it there,
Princess. It's beautiful!

638
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,780
And what of my groom-to-be?
Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

639
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,980
Well, let me put it this way, Princess.

640
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,080
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

641
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:18,250
I don't know. There are those who
think little of him.

642
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,260
Stop it. Stop it,
both of you.

643
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:28,300
You know, you're just jealous that you can never
measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad.

644
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,300
Yeah. Well maybe you're right, Princess.

645
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,700
But I'd let you do the "measuring" when you see him tomorrow.

646
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,970
Tomorrow?
It's take that long?

647
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,780
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No, that'll take longer.

648
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:48,320
- We can keep going.
- But there are robbers in the woods.

649
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:51,720
Whoa! Time out, Shrek!
Camping's starting to sound good.

650
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:55,890
Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than anything
we're going to see in this forest.

651
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,360
I need to find somewhere to camp now!

652
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,310
- Hey! over here.
- Shrek, we can do better than that.

653
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:11,970
Now, I don't think this is fit for a princess.

654
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,840
No, no, it's perfect.
It just needs a few homey touches.

655
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:19,880
- Homey touches? Like what?

656
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,190
A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

657
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,660
Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story? 'cause I will.

658
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,060
I said good night!

659
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,500
Shrek, what are you doing?

660
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,630
I just- You know- Oh, come on.

661
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,300
I was just kidding.

662
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,240
And, uh, that one, that's Throwback,

663
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,680
the only ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

664
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,880
Right. Yeah.

665
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,890
Hey, can you tell my future form these stars?

666
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:01,590
Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey.
They tell stories.

667
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,230
Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent.

668
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,960
- You can guess what he is famous for.
- All right. Now I know you're making this up.

669
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,770
No. Look. There he is,

670
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,900
and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stench.

671
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,570
Man, there ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

672
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,580
You know donkey,
sometimes things are more than they appear.

673
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,850
Hmm?

674
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,980
Forget it.

675
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,560
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway?

676
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,420
Our swamp?

677
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,590
You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff.

678
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:41,400
We? Donkey, there is no "we". There's no "our".

679
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,770
There's just me and my swamp.

680
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:48,140
And the first thing I'm gonna do is build
a ten-foot wall around my land.

681
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,670
You cut me deep, Shrek.

682
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:54,110
You cut me real deep just now.

683
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,150
You know what I think?

684
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,320
I think this whole wall thing
is just a way to keep somebody out.

685
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:03,620
- No, do ya think?
- Are you hidin' something?

686
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,650
Never mind, Donkey.

687
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,090
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

688
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,830
No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it-alone things.

689
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,670
- Why don't you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to talk about it?

690
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,500
- Oh, Why you block?
- I'm not blocking.

691
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,870
- Oh yes you are.
- Donkey, I'm warning you.

692
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,440
- Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who?
- Everyone! Okay?

693
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,180
Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.

694
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,510
Oh, for 'the love of Pete!

695
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,050
Hey, what's your problem Shrek?
What do you got against the whole world anyway?

696
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,350
Look. I'm not the one with the problem, okay?

697
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,390
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.

698
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,330
People take one look at me and go, "Aah! Help! Run!

699
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,160
A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"

700
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:51,470
They judge me, before they even know me.

701
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,500
That's why I'm better off alone.

702
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,610
You know what?

703
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:09,350
When we met, I didn't think you're was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

704
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,350
Yeah, I know.

705
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,860
So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

706
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,330
Well, there's, um, Gabby,

707
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,730
the Small and Annoying.

708
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,700
Okay, okay. I see it, now. The big shiny
one, right there. That's one there?

709
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,970
- That's the moon.
- Oh, okay.

710
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,760
Again. Show me again.

711
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,270
Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.

712
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:06,410
- Hmph.

713
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:11,280
Ah. Perfect.

714
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,480
Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.

715
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:21,820
- Oh come on, baby. I said I like it.
- Donkey, wake up.

716
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,420
- Huh? What?
- Wake up.

717
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,490
- What?
- Good morning.

718
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,830
How do you like your eggs?

719
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,860
- Good morning, Princess!
- What's all this about?

720
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,930
You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday.

721
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I wanted to make it up to you.

722
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:44,640
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

723
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,740
- Uh, thanks.

724
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,610
Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

725
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,990
- Shrek!

726
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,020
What? It's a compliment.

727
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,060
Better out than in, I always say.

728
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:06,860
- Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.

729
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,600
- Thanks
- She's as nasty as you are.

730
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:14,500
You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

731
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:19,680
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

732
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,750
La liberte! Hey!

733
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:26,780
Princess!

734
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,520
- What are you doing?

735
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,560
Be still, mon cherie, for I am your saviour!

736
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:37,060
And I am rescuing you from this green-

737
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,730
- beast.
- Hey!

738
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,130
That's my princess! Go find your own!

739
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,240
Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

740
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,940
Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are!

741
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:53,610
Oh, of course! How rude that was.

742
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,750
Please, let me introduce myself.

743
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:58,710
Oh, Merry Men!

744
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,790
Ta,dah,dah,dah,whoo

745
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,990
I steal from the rich and give to the needy

746
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,190
- He takes a wee percentage
- But I'm not greedy

747
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,260
I rescue pretty damsels
Man, I'm good

748
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:14,330
- What a guy, Monsieur Hood

749
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,270
I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid

750
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,570
- What he's basically saying is he likes to get-
- Paid

751
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,310
- So
- When an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush

752
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,610
- That's bad
- That's bad

753
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,980
When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad

754
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,980
He's mad
He's really, really mad

755
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,950
I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart

756
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,650
Keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause I'm about to start

757
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,860
Man, that was annoying!

758
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,660
Oh, you little...

759
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,990
Um, shall we?

760
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,230
- Hold the phone.

761
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,740
Oh! Whoa!, whoa, whoa. Hold on now.

762
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,840
- Where did that come from?
- What?

763
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,770
That! Back there. That was amazing!

764
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,810
Where did you learn that?

765
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,010
Well- When one lives alone,

766
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,880
uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a-

767
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,550
- There is an arrow in your butt!
- What?

768
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,420
- What? Oh, would you look at that?
- Oh, no. This is all my fault.

769
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,460
- I'm so sorry.
Why? What's wrong?

770
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,890
- Shrek's hurt.
- Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

771
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,770
- Donkey, I'm okay.
You can't do this to me Shrek. I'm too young for you to die.

772
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,970
Keep your legs elevated. Turn your head and cough.

773
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:01,040
- Does anyone know how the Heimlich?
- Donkey! Calm down.

774
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:05,780
If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.

775
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,380
Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns.

776
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,980
Don't die Shrek. And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

777
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,250
- Donkey!
- Oh, yeah. Right. Blue Flower, red thorns.

778
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,590
Blue flower, red thorns.
- What are the flowers for?

779
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,860
- For getting rid of the Donkey.
- Ah.

780
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,390
Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out.

781
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,660
Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

782
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,400
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
- No, it's tender.

783
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,200
Now, hold on.

784
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,370
What you're doing here is the opposite of help.
- Don't move.

785
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,100
- Look, time out.
- Would you-

786
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,680
Okay. What do you propose we do?

787
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,450
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower,
red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

788
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,950
This would be so much easier if I wasn't colour-blind!

789
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:47,080
- Blue flower, red thorns.
- Ow!

790
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,620
Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!

791
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,190
Ow! Not good.

792
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,860
- Okay. Okay, I can nearly see the head.

793
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,560
- It's just about-
- Ow! Ohh!

794
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,030
Ahem.

795
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,440
Nothing happened. We were just, uh-

796
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,310
Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do is ask.

797
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:12,610
Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind.

798
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,380
The princess here was just- Ugh!

799
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,250
- Ow!
- Hey, what's that?

800
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:25,150
That's- Is that blood?

801
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:45,140
My beloved monster and me

802
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:50,910
We go everywhere together

803
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:55,680
Wearin' a raincoat that has four sleeves

804
00:55:55,790 --> 00:56:00,420
- Gets us through all kinds of weather

805
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:05,730
She will always be the only thing

806
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:10,370
That comes between me and the awful sting

807
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:15,500
That comes from living in a world that's so damn mean

808
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:28,950
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

809
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,330
Hey!

810
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,570
- La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

811
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:53,710
La-la, la-la, la-la

812
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,610
There it is, Princess.

813
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:00,080
Your future awaits you.

814
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,420
- That's Duloc?
- Yeah, I know.

815
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:05,150
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's
compensating for something,

816
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,690
which I think means, he has a really- Ow!

817
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,730
Um, I, uh-

818
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:12,230
- I guess we better move on.
- Sure.

819
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,400
But Shrek?

820
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,270
- I'm- I'm worried about Donkey.

821
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,770
- What?
- I mean, look at him.

822
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,870
- He doesn't look so good.
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.

823
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:27,940
Well, that's what they always say, and the
next thing you know, you're on your back.

824
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,450
- Dead.
- You know, she's right.

825
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:33,420
You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

826
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,190
- You know, I'll make you up some tea.
- Well, I didn't want to say nothin',

827
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:39,090
but I've got this twinge in my neck,
and when I turn my head like this, look.

828
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,060
- Ow! See?

829
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,730
- Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
- I'll get the firewood.

830
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:48,330
Hey, where are you goin'? Oh man, I can't feel my toes!

831
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,900
I don't have any toes!

832
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,340
I think I need a hug.

833
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,710
Mmm.

834
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,750
Mmm. This is good. This is really good.

835
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,250
- What is this?
- Uh, weedrat.

836
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,390
Rotisserie style.

837
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,020
No kidding.

838
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,020
Well, this is delicious.

839
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:17,190
Well, they're also great in stews.

840
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:21,500
Now, I don't mean to brag,
but I make a mean wheedrat stew.

841
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:29,400
I guess I'll be dining
a little differently tomorrow night.

842
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:34,540
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime.

843
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,780
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

844
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,780
Swamp toast soup, fish eye tartare- you name it.

845
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,450
I'd like that.

846
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,700
Um, Princess?

847
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,165
- Yes, Shrek?

848
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,075
- I was wondering

849
00:59:04,705 --> 00:59:06,880
Are, you-

850
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,450
Are you gonna eat that?

851
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,360
Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.
- Sunset?

852
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:26,000
Oh, no! I mean, it's late.

853
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,930
- I-It's very late.
- What?

854
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,930
Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here.

855
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,000
- You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
- Yes!

856
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:38,070
Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know I'd better go inside.

857
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:41,480
But don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until-

858
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,310
Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

859
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,550
- Good night.

860
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,690
Good night.

861
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,820
- Ohh!

862
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,690
Oh, what are you talkin' about?

863
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,500
I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

864
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,000
I know that you two are diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

865
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,900
Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

866
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,340
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones.

867
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:13,080
- Just go in and tell her how you feel.
- I-

868
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,180
There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that,

869
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,150
well you know-

870
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:22,790
and I'm not sayin' that I do 'cause I don't-

871
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:25,250
she's a princess and I'm-

872
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,060
An ogre?

873
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,760
Yeah. An ogre.

874
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:34,930
- Hey, where are you goin'?
- To get... more firewood.

875
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,820
Princess?

876
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,650
Princess Fiona?

877
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,730
Princess, where are you?

878
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,500
Princess?

879
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,310
It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

880
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,990
- Aah! - Oh,
no! - No, help!

881
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:35,120
- Shh! - Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

882
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:38,090
- What did you do with the princess?
-Donkey, shhh, I'm the princess.

883
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:40,930
- Aah!
- It's me, in this body.

884
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,600
Oh, my God! You ate the princess!

885
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,570
- Can you hear me? - Donkey!

886
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:47,970
- Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!
- No!

887
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,540
- Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
- Shh.

888
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,480
- Shrek!
- This is me.

889
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,480
Princess?

890
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,020
What happened to you? You're, uh, uh,

891
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,060
uh, different.

892
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,360
- I'm ugly, okay?
- Well, yeah!

893
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,590
Was it something that you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.

894
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,200
- You are what you eat, I said. Now-
-No.

895
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:17,670
I- I've been this way as long as I can remember.

896
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,200
What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

897
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,440
It only happens when the sun goes down.

898
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,480
"By night one way, by day another.

899
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,580
"This shall be the norm...

900
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,780
"until you find true love's first kiss...

901
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,320
and then, take love's true form. "

902
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,920
Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

903
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,960
It's a spell.

904
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,630
When I was a little girl,

905
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:49,400
a witch cast a spell on me.

906
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,000
Every night I become this.

907
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,770
This horrible, ugly beast!

908
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:03,310
I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me.

909
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,020
That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow...

910
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:09,450
before the sun sets and he sees me...

911
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,690
like this.

912
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,060
All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad.

913
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,330
You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly.

914
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,400
But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.

915
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,840
But Donkey, I'm a princess,

916
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,510
and this is not how a princess is meant to look.

917
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:35,340
Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

918
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,350
I have to.

919
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,280
Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell.

920
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:43,850
But you know, you're kind of an ogre,

921
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:47,390
and Shrek- well, you've got a lot in common.

922
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,960
Shrek?

923
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:52,930
Princess, I- Uh, how's it going, first of all?

924
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,800
Good? Um, good for me too.

925
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,800
I'm okay.

926
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,770
I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and-

927
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:07,110
well, I don't really like it, but I thought you may like it, 'cause you're pretty.

928
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,350
But I like you anyway. I'd- uh, uh-

929
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:16,090
I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

930
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,650
I can't just marry whoever I want.

931
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:21,060
Take a good look at me, Donkey.

932
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,090
I mean, really,

933
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,800
who could ever love a beast so hideous and hugly?

934
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,330
"Princess" and "ugly" don't go together.

935
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,800
- That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.

936
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:35,340
My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

937
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,810
- Don't you see, Donkey?

938
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:42,180
That's just how it has to be.

939
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,350
It's the only way to break the spell.

940
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,150
- You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
- No!

941
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:51,150
You can't breathe the word. No one must ever know.

942
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,390
What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

943
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,590
Promise you won't tell. Promise!

944
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:59,800
All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.

945
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,830
I just know, before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.

946
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:06,470
- Look at my eye twitchin'.

947
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:32,900
I tell him, I tell him not.

948
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,400
I tell him, I tell him not.

949
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:39,370
I tell him.

950
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:41,570
Shrek!

951
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,170
Shrek, there's something I want-

952
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:07,200
Shrek.

953
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,670
- Are you all right?
- Perfect!

954
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:12,700
Never been better.

955
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:16,070
I- I don't- There's something I have to tell you.

956
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:18,670
You don't have to tell me anything, Princess.

957
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:20,880
- I heard enough last night.
- You heard what I said?

958
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,880
Every word.

959
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,110
I thought you'd understand?

960
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:27,150
Oh, I understand!

961
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:30,790
Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"

962
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:33,590
But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

963
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,390
Yeah, well, it does.

964
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,200
- Ah, right on time.

965
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,170
Princess, I brought you a little something.

966
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:51,210
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

967
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,980
Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

968
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:57,780
Princess Fiona.

969
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:00,580
As promised. Now hand it over.

970
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:04,920
Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp, cleared out as agreed.

971
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:09,530
Take it and go before I change my mind.

972
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:12,530
Forgive me, Princess, for startling you,

973
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,500
but you startled me,

974
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,230
For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before.

975
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:21,300
I am lord Farquaad.

976
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,270
Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.

977
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:28,310
- Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying...

978
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:33,880
a short... farewell.

979
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:38,620
That is so sweet. You don't have to raise good manners on the ogre.

980
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:40,590
It's not like it has feelings.

981
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:44,630
No. You're right. It doesn't.

982
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:48,730
Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona.

983
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,800
- I ask your hand in marriage.

984
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:56,940
Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

985
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:05,450
Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make-

986
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:08,620
Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wed!

987
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,650
No! I mean, uh,

988
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,120
Why wait?

989
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:17,060
Let's get married today before the sun sets.

990
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,800
Oh, anxious, are we? You're right.

991
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,800
The sooner, the better. There's so much to do!

992
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,240
There is the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list.

993
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:29,340
Captain, round up some guests.

994
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,110
Fare-thee-well, ogre.

995
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:34,840
Shrek, what are you doing? You let her get away.

996
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,610
- Yeah? So what?
- Shrek, there's something about her you don't know.

997
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,120
Look, I talked to her last night. She's

998
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:44,220
Yeah I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya?

999
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:48,090
Now, if you two are such good friends, why didn't you follow her home?

1000
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,130
Shrek, I- I wanna go with you.

1001
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:53,160
I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me.

1002
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:57,200
I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else!

1003
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,400
Understand? Nobody!

1004
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:04,310
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

1005
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:07,580
- But. I thought
- Yeah. You know what?

1006
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,850
You thought wrong!

1007
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:13,520
Shrek.

1008
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:23,290
I heard there was a secret chord

1009
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:26,430
That David played and it pleased the Lord

1010
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:31,370
But you don't really care for music, do ya

1011
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:36,440
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth

1012
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,070
The minor fall the major lift

1013
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:45,820
The baffled king composing hallelujah

1014
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,150
Hallelujah

1015
01:09:49,250 --> 01:10:01,500
Hallelujah

1016
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,900
Baby, I've been here before

1017
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,140
I know this room I've walked this floor

1018
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:15,280
I used to live alone before I knew you

1019
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,080
I've seen your flag on the marble arch

1020
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:23,520
But love is not a victory march

1021
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:28,060
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

1022
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,760
Hallelujah

1023
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,970
Hallelujah

1024
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:39,100
Hallelujah

1025
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,670
Hallelujah

1026
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:50,280
And all I ever learned from love

1027
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,750
Is how to shoot at someone

1028
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,420
- Who outdrew you

1029
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:59,220
And it's not a cry you can hear at night

1030
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:02,360
It's not somebody who's seen the light

1031
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:09,470
- It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

1032
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:12,330
Hallelujah

1033
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:25,680
Hallelujah

1034
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,990
Donkey?

1035
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,290
- What are you doing?

1036
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,360
I would think, of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.

1037
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,330
Well, yeah.

1038
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:46,770
But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.

1039
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:49,670
It is around your half. See, that's your half, and this is my half.

1040
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,340
Oh, your half? Hmm.

1041
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,940
Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.

1042
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,310
I did half the work, I get half the booty.

1043
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:00,750
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.

1044
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:03,120
- Back off!
- No, you back off.

1045
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:05,220
- This is my swamp!
- Our swamp.

1046
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,220
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go.

1047
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,290
- Stubborn jackass!
- Smelly ogre.

1048
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,590
Fine!

1049
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,960
- Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.
- Well, I'm through with you.

1050
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:18,300
Uh-uh. Well, you know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!"

1051
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,000
Well, guess what! Now it's my turn!

1052
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,170
So you just shut up and pay attention!

1053
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:25,210
You are mean to me.

1054
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,840
You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do!

1055
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:31,050
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

1056
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:34,920
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

1057
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:38,220
Because that's what friend do! They forgive each other!

1058
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:41,490
Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey.

1059
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:45,830
I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back!

1060
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:51,300
Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.

1061
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:54,840
- Go away!
- There you are, doing it again just like you did to Fiona.

1062
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:57,540
And all she ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

1063
01:12:57,610 --> 01:13:01,740
Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature.

1064
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,780
I heard the two of youtalking.

1065
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:05,750
She wasn't talking about you.

1066
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:08,150
She was talking about, uh, somebody else.

1067
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,090
She wasn't talking about me?

1068
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:15,490
Well, then who was she talking about?

1069
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:18,290
Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me.

1070
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:20,700
- Right? Right?
- Donkey!

1071
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,300
- No!
- Okay, look.

1072
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,300
I'm sorry, all right?

1073
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:28,870
Hmph.

1074
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:33,840
I'm sorry.

1075
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:38,180
I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

1076
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:41,350
Can you forgive me?

1077
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:45,490
Hey, that's the friends are for, right?

1078
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:48,190
Right. Friends?

1079
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,230
Friends.

1080
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:53,260
So, um,

1081
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,600
what did Fiona say about me?

1082
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:58,800
What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

1083
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:01,900
The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

1084
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:05,170
Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where there's a will, there's a way.

1085
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,410
And I have a way.

1086
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,220
- Donkey?

1087
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,690
I guess this is just my animal magnetism.

1088
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:19,960
Aw, come here, you.

1089
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,830
All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass.

1090
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,430
All right, hop on and hold on tight.

1091
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:29,030
I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts yet.

1092
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,940
Whoo!

1093
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:03,200
People of DuLoc,

1094
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:06,000
we gather here today...

1095
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,070
to bear witness...

1096
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,140
- to the union...
- Um-

1097
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:12,680
- of our new king-
- Excuse me.

1098
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:15,380
- Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

1099
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,410
Go on.

1100
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:26,090
Go ahead, have some fun. If we need you, I'll whisle. How about that?

1101
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,630
Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute!

1102
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:33,400
- You want to do this right, don't you?
- What are you talking about?

1103
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,400
There's a line, There's a line you gotta wait for.

1104
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,970
The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace. "

1105
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:41,800
- That's when you say, "I object!"
- I don't have time for this!

1106
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,640
Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!

1107
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:45,610
- Look, you love this woman, don't you?
- Yes.

1108
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,980
- You wanna hold her?
- Yes.

1109
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,280
- Please her?
- Yes!

1110
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:51,980
Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness

1111
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:54,850
- The chicks love that romantic crap!
- All right! Cut it out.

1112
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:58,520
- When does this guy say the line?
- We gotta check it out.

1113
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,790
- And so, by the power vested in me,

1114
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:05,090
- What do you see?
- The whole town's in there.

1115
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:08,330
- I know pronounce you husband and wife,
- They're at the altar.

1116
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,000
- king and queen.
- Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

1117
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:13,700
- Oh, for the love of Pete!

1118
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:17,010
I object!

1119
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:19,180
- Shrek?

1120
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,180
Oh, now what does he want?

1121
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:27,750
Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya?

1122
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,090
I love DuLoc, first of all.

1123
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:32,660
- Very clean.
- What are you doing here?

1124
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,660
Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you.

1125
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,060
- but showing up uninvited to a wedding-
- Fiona!

1126
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,160
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?

1127
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:45,230
Well, it's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me-

1128
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,700
- But you can't marry him.
- And why not?

1129
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,670
Because- Because he's just marrying you so he can be king.

1130
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,110
Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

1131
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:57,810
- He's not your true love.
- And what do you know about true love?

1132
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,250
Well, I- Uh-

1133
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:03,720
I mean-
- Oh, this is precious.

1134
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:08,460
the ogre has fallen in love with the princess!

1135
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,830
- Oh, good Lord.

1136
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:12,800
An ogre and a princess!

1137
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,940
Shrek, is this true?

1138
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,910
Who cares? It's preposterous!

1139
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:28,610
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away for our "happily ever after. "

1140
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,310
Now kiss me! Mmmm!

1141
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:38,720
"By night one way, by day another. "

1142
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:43,390
I wanted to show you before.

1143
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,520
Well, uh,

1144
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,590
that explains a lot.

1145
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:14,360
Ugh! It's disgusting!

1146
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,460
Guards! Guards!

1147
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,730
I order you to get that out of my sight now! Get them!

1148
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,570
- Get them both!
- No, no!

1149
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:26,470
This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king!

1150
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,800
- See? See?
- No, let go of me! Shrek!

1151
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,640
- No!
Don't just stand there, you morons.

1152
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:33,240
Get out of my way! Fiona!

1153
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,410
Arrgh!

1154
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:41,480
I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and quartered!

1155
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:44,490
- You'll beg for death to save you!
- No! Shrek!

1156
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:48,060
- And as for you, my wife.
- Fiona!

1157
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,860
I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!

1158
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,760
- I am king!

1159
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:56,630
I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have-

1160
01:18:57,970 --> 01:19:00,970
Aaah!

1161
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,840
- Aah!
- All right. Nobody move.

1162
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:05,980
I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it.

1163
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:08,680
- I'm a donkey on the edge!

1164
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,750
Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

1165
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:19,760
Go ahead Shrek.

1166
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,460
Uh, Fiona?

1167
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:26,800
Yes, Shrek?

1168
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:30,900
I- I love you.

1169
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,270
Really?

1170
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:37,340
Really, really.

1171
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,340
I love you too.

1172
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:46,480
Aawww!

1173
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:51,620
"Until you find true love's first kiss...

1174
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:55,060
and then take love's true form. "

1175
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,520
"Take love's true form. Take love's true form. "

1176
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,190
Fiona?

1177
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:35,260
Fiona.

1178
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,930
Are you all right?

1179
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,940
Well, yes.

1180
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:43,240
But I don't understand.

1181
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,470
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

1182
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,410
But you are beautiful.

1183
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,420
I was hoping this would be a happy ending.

1184
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,630
<i>I thought love was only true in fairy tales</i>

1185
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,155
Oy!

1186
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:08,400
<i>Meant for someone else but not for me</i>

1187
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,370
<i>Love was out to get me</i>

1188
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:17,240
<i>That's the way it seemed</i>

1189
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:21,810
<i>Disappointment haunted all my dreams</i>

1190
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,150
<i>And then I saw her face</i>

1191
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:28,050
<i>Now I'm a believer</i>

1192
